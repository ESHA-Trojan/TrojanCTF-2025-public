Name: Pretty High Prices
Description:
    Honestly, these food prices are outrageous. How do they expect anyone to be able to pay $50 for two pizzas???
    There's no way this business will be feasible on today's economy. I tried complaining to the company through their contact form, but it seems to be broken.
    Maybe I can somehow leave them a message if I get access to a server shell. I guess it's time to put my CTF skills into practice!
