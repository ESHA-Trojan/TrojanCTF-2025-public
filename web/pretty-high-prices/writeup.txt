setup:
docker build -t php-ctf .
docker run -p 8000:80 php-ctf

goal:
- Read '/home/ctfuser/flag.txt', which can only be read using sudo (so RCE is required)
- Use php:// filters to get RCE
See: https://www.synacktiv.com/publications/php-filters-chain-what-is-it-and-how-to-use-it
     https://github.com/synacktiv/php_filter_chain_generator

steps:
1. locate util.php and observe how it tries to read instructions.pdf (indication that challenge is related to include function)
2. (ab)use the PHP extract function to overwrite the 'stat_filename' variable
See: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.extract.php
3. Confirm you're able to read '/etc/passwd' via: '/util.php?key=static_fileName&value=/etc/passwd'
4. execute arbitrary code by either:
- php filters
- (unintented) Get userinput from running processes /proc, /self/proc/, etc; to execute PHP via include() (/var/log/apache2 -> stderr&stdout)
5. Dockerfile shows you can run 'sudo -u ctfuser cat /home/ctfuser/flag.txt' (-u specifies the user)
