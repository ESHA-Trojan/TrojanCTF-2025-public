  Come on, get away from that computer screen. Let your eyes rest a bit. Take a break, grab a snack or a drink or something...
  In the meantime, Whitehats have lost their white hat somewhere in Auditorium. If you come accross it, make sure to scan the **2** NFC tags on it. There is a flag there to prove that you found it. **Please leave it at the same place!**

  The scope is **everywhere** in Auditorium, reachable by open doors, or by lecture halls. You are free to enter and look around in lecture halls, but please do not open any other closed doors.
