# Triple Subs
The idea is to get a large text file, i.e. a play of shakespeare or something like that, and do a substitution cipher on triplets of characters. 
This should be solveable if there is some data on which triplet appears most often, with a large wordlist of english words.

## Alternative:
First, try it with tuples of two letters, see if that is possible.
