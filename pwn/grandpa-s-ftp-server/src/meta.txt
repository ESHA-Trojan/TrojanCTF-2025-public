name: Grandpa's FTP Server
description:
    My grandpa asked me to help him add the newest technology to his home server. When I asked him what that meant, he said I should add an FTP server so he can more easily reach his files.
    I've managed to set it up, but he insisted that I integrate it with his existing authentication server. That server is one of the slowest things I have ever seen!
    Logging in to the server takes forever because of this! Anyway, it's done, so he can go enjoy his files now.

    PS: due to technical restrictions, usernames and password can only contain upper- or lower case letters, digits, underscores and dashes. The flag format is Trojan{username:password}

username: gRamP5
