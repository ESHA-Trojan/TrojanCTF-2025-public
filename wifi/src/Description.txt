CTF Challenge Description: "Push the Right Buttons"

Category: Wi-Fi Hacking

Points: 200

Difficulty: Medium

Description:

Our security team set up an access point called CTF_WPS_AP. They've left WPS enabled, believing it to be secure with their "complex" PIN. Your job is to prove them wrong. Crack the WPS PIN and retrieve the WPA2 pre-shared key (PSK) to gain access.

SSID: CTF_WPS_APBSSID: Provided on-site

Goal:

Provide the WPA2 PSK of the network to solve this challenge.

Hint: Sometimes default settings aren't as secure as they seem.
