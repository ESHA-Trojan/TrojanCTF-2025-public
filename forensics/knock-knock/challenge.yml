  Following suspicious activity from one of our company's computers, we recorded its
  network traffic. Analyzing the resulting file, we noticed that it is communicating
  with a specific address, but the packets it sends are empty. Our suspicion is that
  it is trying to secretly send data to this address. Can you confirm this?
