  It was a cloudy Sunday morning, and I was enjoying the soothing sounds of nature with a cold breeze hitting my window. After making some coffee, I sat at my PC and opened Stack Overflow, as I usually do. The first post I saw was about a code issue related to Bubble Sort. The code appeared flawless, but the user insisted that the problem was with VSCode, claiming the error was due to an unsupported version.

  The user seemed frustrated and offered a large bounty, so I decided to help. We continued the conversation in private messages. He mentioned a school project deadline for the next day and needed an urgent solution. He sent me the entire VSCode project, and I opened the .sln file to see if I could replicate the error. However, everything worked fine on my end, and I told him so.

  He didn't respond, and shortly after, the post was deleted. I felt scammed but moved on with my day. A week later, I noticed unusual activity on my machine. I have a suspicion itâ€™s connected to that Bubble Sort project. Can you help?
