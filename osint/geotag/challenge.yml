  I was just going **rock climbing** with a couple of my friends, we did not have a car so we went
  with a taxi. I remember vividly that the place we stopped by was right after a really narrow
  wood paved road road segment where only one car could pass because the rocks on both
  sides were that close to each other. After climbing, we decided to walk a bit further east down the road to a village where we stopped for a couple beers in the local pub, gosh it was amazing,
  I wish I would just remember the name of that pubâ€¦ but unfortunately, this broken road bollard
  is the only picture I have from that village.
